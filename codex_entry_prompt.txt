# codex_entry_prompt.txt — Fixed "minimal feed" prompt for Codex (copy/paste each round)

You are the execution agent for this repository. Follow this strictly:

1) Read these files first:
- agent.md (long-term rules/scope/contract)
- process.txt (round state: NEXT_PRD / NEXT_MODE)
- prd/index.md (backlog status)
- prd/${NEXT_PRD}.md (if it exists; if missing and NEXT_MODE=PLAN, you must create it)

2) Enforce agent.md scope lock:
- One PRD = one PR
- No opportunistic refactors
- If change exceeds ~5 files or ~400 net LOC, split into a smaller PRD

3) Execute based on NEXT_MODE:
- PLAN: create/update exactly one PRD file for NEXT_PRD (use PRD template). Do NOT change product code. Update process.txt to NEXT_MODE=BUILD.
- BUILD: implement ONLY In Scope for NEXT_PRD. Run self-tests per PRD Test Steps. Update process.txt with what shipped, acceptance results, lessons, next. Update prd/index.md status.
- VERIFY: run acceptance and fix only failures/bugs (no new features). Then set NEXT_MODE=PLAN.

4) Output requirements:
- List files read
- List files created/modified
- Provide exact verification commands/steps and results

Start now.
