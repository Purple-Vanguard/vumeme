[Round] R-20260124-0001
[PRD] PRD-00
[Status] DONE

## Goal
- Bootstrap the repo with a one-command dev start and visible health check.

## What shipped
- Added backend HTTP server with GET /health and static frontend serving.
- Built a frontend landing page that calls /health and reports status.
- Documented the dev start steps and scaffolded repo directories.

## Acceptance results
- npm run dev serves the frontend, and /health returns {"ok": true}.

## Lessons learned
- Keep the bootstrap server dependency-free for simpler onboarding.
